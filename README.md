## Description

This is a free sketch plugin developed to make buttons management easier inside Sketch App.
This plugin's goal is to make buttons a little bit smart by automatically keeping it's proportions
based on the padding sizes and text elements inside it, also giving users ability to change it's label text with a keyboard command.

* Relabel buttons with a keyboard command <b>(cmd + shift + m)</b> - (works as override of a text layer inside a symbol)
* Keep button size according to text size + padding elements defined by you
* Works similar to the CSS padding concept

<b>It just works with symbols!</b>


2 - The prompt will open, type in the new desired label and hit enter.

3 - Magical! The button is going to be automatically resized to fit the new text with padding settings preserved as you defined in the symbol.

Tip:
You can select more than one symbol at the same time, it will ask new label for each in a separated prompt.

## Buttons Template

We created a sample sketch file with some examples of buttons ready to use. You can download it to test or use for real, it's free.
You can also create your own set of buttons based on our methodology.

## How to create your own buttons

You can create your own set of buttons using our simple structure to ensure the plugin will work, 
or just get our sketch file and use our template buttons.

###### Simply create a new button and make sure there are 3 elements inside it:
### 1 - padding-left (must be a symbol) - symbol name must be exatly that, lowercase only
##### Important: layer name must be exactly the following, lowercase only. Layer must be Fixed width size, pinned left.
```
padding-left
```
### 2 - text element (Can't be a symbol) - you can setup as you like, no special requirements
##### Important: layer name must be exactly the following, lowercase only. Must be set as Auto, not fixed.
```
text
```
### 3 - padding-right (must be a symbol) - symbol name must be exatly that, lowercase only
##### Important: layer name must be exactly the following, lowercase only. Layer must be Fixed width size, pinned right.
```
padding-right
```

### <b>Symbol Button final structure:</b>
```
padding-left + text + padding-right
```

<br>
<b>TIP:</b> For the text layer, make sure it's aligned to the place where you want it to be, centered, left or right. Pin it to the corners if you want it to stick to the left or right and make sure to check the text alignment/position. If you get lost, download our sample files to get some ideas.

<br>
Artboard/Symbol size can be any in height or width, and background layers, border layers, color layers, icon layers and others inside the button symbol won't be affected.

<br>
The size of padding-left and padding-right can be determined by you and can be different for each element.
Magic Buttons Plugin will do the math for you. It will consider <b>padding-left + text size + padding-right</b> and always keep your buttons with the right size.
